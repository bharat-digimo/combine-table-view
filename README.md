# CombineTableView
Simplify UITableView implementation using Combine and modern Swift features like async/await and @MainActor. This project demonstrates building a clean, scalable, and maintainable table view with reactive data binding.

## Features
- Combine-based Data Binding: Automatically update the table view when data changes.
- Modern Swift: Uses async/await for networking and @MainActor for thread-safe UI updates.
- Decoupled Architecture: Separates the data source from the view controller for better testability and maintainability.
- Reusable Components: Includes extensions for simplifying table view setup and cell dequeueing.
